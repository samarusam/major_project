Carbon Nano Tube Field Effect Transistors (CNTFETs) are having unique feature of alteration
of threshold voltage by variations in CNT diameter to implement multi valued logic designs. 
Multi-valued logic design is a best alternative that offers a higher number of data/information which leads to energy efficiency,
higher information density and reduced circuit in terms of interconnect complexity. 
In this project we design transmission gate and 
Dynamic shift registers using Carbon Nano Tube CNT technology Performance metrics like delay, 
power and PDP were calculated using  CADENCE tool. And also the performance of these circuits was compared with that of MOSFET circuits.
